I had several dead pixels all across the screen and I knew multiple people that had the phone that also had the same problem never touching a fold again also, the battery life is awful because they have to put in a pretty small battery to fit it between the hinges",

But you can buy a galaxy tab 11 and an s25 ultra for substantially cheaper than the tri fold. Were talking an almost 1000 dollar difference. On top of that the s25 ultra is a better phone and the tab 11 is a better tablet than this tri fold is. Its the classic example of when you try to make a 2 in 1 device, it fails to be great at both. In this case it isnt about performance but cost. If this was 2k, it would be a different story. So the question is, is the agility to fold a tablet into your pocket worth an extra 1000? For me its a no",

Straight up. \n\nLook, it's a cool phone I get it, but getting a flagship brick is apx $1k.\n\nI get that cost/engineering wise it's 4 screens, but come on? $2500 is a LOT of money considering the hardware is literally the same as a flagship and so the *only actual real value add here* is, oh, a bigger screen?\n\nThe cost of being able to triple (if the aspect ratio works out) your screen size is an additional $1500!? No. That's more additional cost than simply buying 2 flagship phones at $1000 per phone.\n\n That means you're paying more than 2x flagship phones, but you don't get 2x cpus or battery. You pay more than double simply for more hinges and extra fancy glass. This goes to say that that the company is passing on the RND costs of a brand new technology (folding screens) straight to the consumer. This phone is stupid expensive because folding screen technology is expensive and personally I don't think the $1500 addtl cost justifies the experience of a slightly larger screen.\n\nTo drive the point home, it would be significantly cheaper to buy both a tablet and a smartphone. You literally pay a stupid amount extra just to be able to fold them as one device lol.",

        "text": "If you are going to make a \"phablet\" foldable, it has to be a 3x inside screen. I could kind of get the first Samsung Fold, as the outer screen was almost usable with one hand, meaning that you had one hand operation, that could unfold to a larger \"Phablet\" device. When the folding phones got up to outer screens that were \"phablet\" sized, so no one could use them with one hand, they simply did not make sense, as the aspect ratio of the inner screen, just like brought up in this video, made it so that the video experience wasn't any better.\nThe only possible advantage I could see for a folding Phablet, is if can act like a small computer, where one screen pane could be used as a thumb keyboard. But still, there was no reason to make the outer screen two handed.\nAt this point I much prefer the Flips, as the out screens, almost make them one hand useable at this point. I guess the downsides are that the camera set-ups are even worse. You really do need a tripple camera set-up on a mobile, as the optical zoom helps with capturing details, whereas the \"ultra-wide\" is very usable for typical photos, but sacrificing the performance of the standars (wide-angle).\nAnd if they make the outer screens on folds, big enough to be really good for one handed use, in a nice aspect ratio, the inner display, will turn in to a ultra-ultra-wide screen, that we don't have much use for.\n\nThe main issue with these 3x screen phablets, besides still not offering a single hand operation on the outer screen, is that they don't make sense.\nWhy do you need to be able to pocket a tablet?\nAnd if you need to be able to do that, would it not then make more sense to separate the tablet from the phone. Imagine a folding tablet, that doesn't need 5G modem, that doesn't need a decent camera set-up (a single behind the screen one for video calls would be sufficient), thus could use the thickness that the camera bumps come with, instead for spreading the thickness over all panes and enable larger battery inside. That doesn't need an outer display. Where wireless charging doesn't make sense, so they could spare room in that department as well.",

The first thing that I thought of when I saw you unfold it was \"wait, they're doing it the dumb way that would need a whole extra screen\" and then you showed the other phone that did it the correct way.\n\nThis thing has essentially 4 screens when they could have had better results (like having the dual screen option) with only 3.  The only thing the 4th screen does is jack up the price.  What a stupid design.\n\nAlso, I've always thought all folding screens are stupid since you can design it in such a way where you have a micro bezel between separate screens. While that would certainly look worse, it would be far, far more reliable/durable and rugged than a limp bending screen. \n\nLastly who in the hell is spending 3k on a phone? Great, another tech product for the rich while all the other things are bought up by ai slop barons driving those prices beyond normal peoples budgets.",

You could have picked so many other phones and those would have been *much* better indicators of \"telling the story of the year.\" For example, a silicon anode battery. Remember when you mentioned how incredible of a leap that was? For another, how about all of the leaps in screen technology? Apple still uses screens that are half a decade behind their competitors. How about all of the new usable ai features? I abhor the direction ai is going in, but there are some features worth rewarding as they definitively changed how people interact with their phones day-to-day. But no, this phone whose only meaningful update was \"being a slightly more acceptable value\" is apparently the poster child for 2025 mobile technology. Genuinely, the iPhone 17 was one of the few objectively incorrect options for this award.",

Mostly because it just looks like a normal big phone and they are blown away that it's a foldable.  It genuinely feels like a top tier regular large phone in regular use, but I can bust out that tablet mode whenever I want.  I went on a business trip to Argentina and it was great, when I wanted to show pictures etc to friends/co-workers etc nothing is better.  One person in particular said I might've convinced them to get one themselves (despite me not trying to sell it or anything lol), so he must've been on the fence.  \n\nAs for the battery, it's plenty.  On this business trip where I used it for Ubers to get around anywhere, for tap to pay (to let my bank handle currency conversions at a favorable rate), for maps constantly to see where I was going next, and for constant messaging since I was going to a conference and bouncing around all sorts of events etc.  Then I sent photos and messages back to my wife etc.  By the end of the day I think the lowest it ever got to was around 40-50%, usually it was 60%+.  I honestly don't know how I could've used it more in a realistic scenario.  So yeah battery capacity was not an issue for me at all, after that first day seeing it only get to like 60% my worries all went away.",

A phone has to be rated on its complete package, that's what it offers, what it can do, what it brings to the market above all others, build, and obviously a phone is only as good as it's software..... Iphone AI from its camera software to actual voice controls, Apples AI in any form is rubbish period, and based on this NO apple should win any awards.... If you cannot ask Siri a basic question like you can as on android or edit photos or video like you can on android but fails on Apple then that's a massive negative on the apple eco system, this alone should put apple off the list, and that's before we even talk about the scratch on all phones 17s but for the air",

Seems like a directed plan to have one plus fan leave because people really care about the camera that's on their phone and when the new phone is made so well but has crummy cameras not even as good as a mid-grade then you don't want to buy the phone unless you don't use cameras they also downgraded the resolution on the OnePlus 15 which is why I'm so disappointed in it because the Oppo Find X9 pro looked good. They got rid of the OnePlus pro versions. I would actually have paid more to get the OnePlus 15 with the cameras off of the OnePlus open. And call it the pro.

Just my honest opinion. The extra features premium phones offer is only a marginal increase for which you have to shell out a huge amount. Beware !",

Y'all ain't 90% of real world usage and people. Most people don't give 2 shits about refresh rate and what \"Chip\" they have in their phone. The 16e is a perfectly fine phone for most people. It's also a huge corporate phone. It's also very cheap on most carrier deals. Not a bust at all.",

I assume this might be the most difficult category to implement and will absolutely require a lot of research and digging behind the claims but it would be instructive for the environmentally conscious buyers, since most smart phones are capable, it would be nice to see tech companies making a real effort not to negatively impact the plant with their products.",

Samsung has a new display filter and the display has changed the polarization blackout when wearing sunglasses. I knew the screen was brighter , but brighter in combination with the polarization change was HUGE in quality of life for this Florida guy... I had to google it and Samsung claims it's gone, but I notice it still at a 45 degree angle, but in portrait and landscape the phone is 100% viewable with sunglasses on and in the direct sun. My wife has a Z flip 7 and says hers is the same now too but I haven't looked at it for myself. It is worth buying the phone just for that alone if you live in Florida and in sunglasses all day.",

In T\u00fcrkiye, the pre-tax price of the 16e comes out to around $450, while the regular iPhone 16 is roughly $700. (Also the iPhone 15 pro is around $825)\n\nSo the real gap isn\u2019t $100 \u2014 it\u2019s closer to $250. That makes the 16e a genuinely good deal here.\n\nThe reason is simple: in high-inflation markets like ours, most people can\u2019t afford regular iPhones anymore. Apple needs the 16e priced this way just to stay competitive and keep a foothold in the market.",

However, advancing technology will still allow fossil fuel corporations to extract oil from nonconventional sources like shale or source rock. So the concept of a Peak Oil time-clock will have to be postpone. In the U.S.A. it is not a depletion of oil but when unconventional oil exploration, extraction, refining & transport becomes so financially expensive for fossil fuel corporations to stay profitable for their share holders that the transition to cheaper, faster to setup renewable energy in the forms of solar, wind & geothermal energies will become dominant. Geothermal energy also has the advantage of benefiting from existing oil drilling technology.\nAmerica needs to wake-up before it\u2019s too late.",

Every level of service provided by domestic manufacturers would not be there unless you add to the price the costs of providing the costs of making the desired services available. I don\u2019t like how much we pay for cars but cutting costs always means removing some part of the business structure. Fire all the salesman and order online to reduce costs more often means same price just more bonuses to the shareholders. Repair your own car instead of the dealer will result in no local access to parts as dealers close shops. I just believe Chinese cars might enter the market cheaply because they will flood the market to attain share but to compete they would need a dealer infrastructure and those resulting costs would follow",

Those are the biggest reason they aren\u2019t available internationally. It took them less than 5 years to develop this car from scratch\u2026so it seems unlikely they couldn\u2019t fix the glaring safety concerns & launch in US/UK markets quite easily. I was really hoping the stock decline after being caught out lying about their sales numbers would result in a launch to our market but no such luck. \ud83d\ude22",

Just google the mass complains of Xiaomi's and other chinese EV and Mobile Phones, for their quality issues, after purchase support (warranty) practices, dangers of exploding and catching fire due to bad battery.

So no we are not \"Cooked,\" and this clown is promoting and praising chinese tech and cars? gtfo here.  What did Xiaomi or one of their agent or shell companies give you, did they give you a free Xiaomi EV and Phone, because we know they give you access as we can see ?",

Just because of Siri and AI which Apple doesnt have, i will change by all devices it seems. Siri makes me sick, doesnt understand me, even if she applies what i said it says i can not complete. You said turn off light, it turns off all lights not the homepods room which takes order. Google doesnt have this stupid problems. I can not beleive to Apple. Is there on or two persons involved to Siri in Apple???",

Same this with music. Siri does a lot of this on your iPhone and it's not that bad. But for sure I'll never use it to search any information on the internet or something like that because for THAT it's definitely useless. Also when I loose my phone I ask Siri where he is and he answers so I can locate it by sound \ud83e\udd23",

No voicemail to text without a third party app. Camera apps constantly drops frames when hooting video.  Default slow shutter speed resulting in blurry pictures of anything slightly moving. Alarms that get turned down after my phone updates in the middle of the night.  And much more. I build my own computers and am a gamer so you think I would be an android guy but after using an s21 ultra for few years and switching to an iPhone the software is just so much more reliable.  Also Bixbi was better than Siri. lol",

Yea siri can call, send msg, play a song but so does a 2020 google assistant without gpt and apple intelligence integration. There are a lot of instances where my old google assistant gives me direct ans or does what im telling it to do than siri's \"heres something i found on web\"",

        "text": "Super not a fan of USB-C for a mouse dongle. When I use the dongle on mine, it's because I'm connecting it to something I can't conveniently pair it to with bluetooth (usually a desktop, or a dock at work). My personal desktop only has 3 USB-C ports, 2 of which are already always in use. If my mouse takes up the third, that locks me out of any USB-C flash drives, SSDs, etc. Meanwhile, I have 14 USB-A ports. And my PC is pretty new. If I tried to pair it to my friend's desktop, I'd have to crawl under his desk and unplug is external SSD to get to the single USB-C port he has on the rear of his machine. \n\nI guess this makes it easier to use the dongle with laptops that shed their USB-A ports, but they all have bluetooth anyways, and wouldn't need the dongle.",

        "text": "I love my Galaxy Tab S10 Plus, 12.4inch AMOLED display, 12gb RAM, only 256gb internal storage but I have a 256gb MicroSD in it so 512gb combined, the included S Pen and the Type Cover that came bundled with my tablet even though it wasn't suppose to but did anyways... and then the MediaTek Dimensity 9300+ CPU which at first I wasn't happy that Samsung would dare put a MediaTek anything in their devices I have always seen MediaTek as the lowest of ends tech company makes things as cheap as humanly possible so they break and you go buy another, and another, and another, in a really short period of time, as that has been my experience with MediaTek components... But, I wasn't going to get the S10+ FE because of its LED screen, 90hz instead of 120hz display, and the Exynos CPU which is literally twice as slow, sometimes 3 times slower then the MediaTek Dimensity 9300+ in every single way, same with the graphics performance, and only like $150 cheaper (going by my Tab S10 Plus being on sale at the time) and I am really sensitive to performance, I can not stand a slow device, it has to be a super smooth experience, no stuttering at all, or lag, or generally being slow to do the task I want it to do, and so I chose the Tab S10 Plus over the S10 Plus FE even though I would have gotten a larger display at 13.1inches, and a slightly longer lasting battery given the LCD screen instead of AMOLED but with OLED displays as long as you use black in most things like themes and whatnot, you can really increase that battery life, and also use things like Display Assistant in the GoodLock app to force apps to run at lower refresh rates, like streaming apps that never play anything above 30fps or depending on the service, 60fps, so limiting it to 60hz will look no different when playing your shows or youtube videos, and also good to set for when you are reading, so Kindle or Google Books. I know the display should auto adjust refresh rates but in some apps it doesn't so it helps to set them. So that being said, My Tab S10 Plus has amazing battery life, longer then my Galaxy S23 Ultra by a little bit though my phone is older and has half the battery and less then half the display which you would think would work in its favor but doesn't, and it comes down to that MediaTek Dimensity 9300+ being quite a bit more power efficient while being more powerful in general then the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 For Galaxy in the S23 Ultra, even though the For Galaxy versions are more power efficient and a bit better performing then the standard Gen 2 CPU's. Also the S10 Plus has 7 years of support, 6 now where the FE only gets 5 if I recall and it is half way through its first year, so not as long. \n\nA side note, I love how thin the Tab S10 Plus is, but it is also a little annoying when holding it and accidentally pressing the screen because of how little space you get between the edge and where the screen starts. Thinner then my S23 Ultra, but wish there just slightly more space between the screen and edge of the device. But overall I am blown away by the tablets performance, the fact it still as MicroSD expansion, and really just how large the thing is yet it is really thin, yet still fits a 10090mAh battery in it somehow. I have a Galaxy Tab A7, absolutely pathetic little 10inch tablet, slow at everything but will eventually do everything, is absolutely put to shame by the Tab S10 Plus, there is no competing, worlds better in every way and my best tablet experience to date (the Tab S10 Plus) and that is even comparing my Surface Pro 7, which was 12.3inch, but only a 59.98hz LCD screen which hurt my eyes when anything moved, part of the reason I sold it a few years ago, but missed the Windows Touch experience as it was pretty decent, something I get back with my 14inch Lenovo Thinkpad L14 Gen 3 AMD version, which has a touch screen even though it wasn't suppose to according to the listing, and it has a proper 60hz display, not a 59.98hz display, and that really does make a difference, like a lot more then you would think. Moving things doesn't look nearly as terrible, though still kind of bad, but doesn't make my eyes hurt and make me feel sick. The laptop's hardware is great until you get to the battery being a tiny 42wh battery and the display at its max brightness is only just fine in a room with the lights on, terrible when outside or in a room with a lot of natural lighting, I mainly have it as a fall back system and also a work machine set up in my office with a secondary display on an arm above it, and I only charge it when it gets around 15%, and unplug it as soon as it hits 100%, I never leave it plugged into its charger when I am not using it.",

Hard to spend premium price for a mouse with such a short life span. Based on forum threads it sounds like this is a common known problem with Logitech's switch selection, not just bad luck in the ones I've bought. At this point I hate to give them more money, but in terms of functionality and form you can't really find a good competitor. Anyone else having same frustration?",

        "text": "Your content is great, but the way you talk about speakers felt quite lacking compared to how knowledgeable you are in most other fields. \u201cDelivering 108 db\u201d and filling the room. Sure, but it\u2019s not really doing that, it\u2019s measured at 108 dB SPL at 1 meter. Typically you\u2019d sit 4 meters away from the speaker in a typical living room and then the dB drops off significantly and maybe you\u2019ll be closer to 90 dB with peaks at 95. In a smaller room maybe you\u2019d really fill out the room well, but in the end, that is a small speaker and if you want some really good bass performance with proper deepness you\u2019d need to add in a subwoofer. Quote from the clip: \u201cit fills the room, whatever the size of the room\u201d. Brother, this is like saying a Porsche can carry the same amount of cargo as a truck no matter the size of the cargo. The room plays a huge part in how a speaker sounds. With that said, they can still sound great and filling, but he oversells it in the clip and having \u201cloudness\u201d as a measure for quality is imho quite useless since 98.7% of the speakers on the market can get crazy loud in that price range.",

I moved to the Swiftpoint Z2, which is kinda the pro (but unfortunately wired) version of the MX 4.

The added buttons make gestures also a lot more convenient, since you can still have some buttons that only work on click, and others for gesture controls (switch screens, apps, tabs, volume).",

And it doesn't actually matter if I'm using a Logitech mouse or some other mouse as long as the Logitech software is installed. The problem goes away when it's uninstalled. So I just stopped using Logitech mice completely. I use vertical thumb trackball mice now anyways and there are a few really good ones that are not Logitech.",

Especially the Nikon Z8 and Z6\u202fIII are excellent. They are top-tier hybrid cameras, and the Z8, for example, supports internal 8K RAW at 60\u202fFPS with amazing image quality\u2014and it was released in May 2023. So it\u2019s not true that we had to wait for the first \u201cgood\u201d mirrorless camera from Nikon. But the Nikon ZR is now a really competitive video camera, especially compared to the FX3!\n\nFor the Nikon ZR, I can recommend the SmallRig Cage. It comes with a hand grip extension that matches the design of the camera. SmallRig also sells a very good Micro HDMI to Full HDMI converter that can be screwed onto the cage.",

Lack of customization with the home screen and app drawer. Traded it in for the 12 hoping it would be better. It wasn't. All the same issues were still there. \nYes, the lack of customization can be fixed with a launcher, but not when the phones UI issues bleed over into the launcher, literally every launcher I tried that gave me what I wanted was unusable for a seemless, lag and glitch free experience. Random black screens when going back to home screen from an app. Just random navigation lag and stuttering when do simple things. The status bar just randomly disappearing forcing me to restart the phone to get it back. And the official OnePlus clock widget on my home screen where most of it would be gone except for like a little sliver of it, I would have to delete and add again to fix. Every day I would have to deal with multiple issues, The 12 was basically identical to all the 11s issues. \nI bought a S25 Ultra and the only thing I miss is the media gesture controls when the screen is off. Still have the 12, but if I were to lose it tomorrow, I wouldn't notice, it's a paperweight after all.\n\n**Oh, I forgot to mention, the big radii making up the corners of the 15s screen are HIDEOUS!!! Yeah, nothing I like more than the corners of my apps, games, and media being cast into the void! Haha, what a joke.",

Well made and all matte at a good price compared to Samsung and Apple. In the end, it was an easy choice.",

OnePlus is owned by Chinese firm BKK Electronics (who owns Oppo and Vivo). OnePlus is Oppo's sister phone.\n\nIn Comparison with Samsung there appears to be several 4G and 5G bands that Samsung doesn't support (per GSMArena). Has higher display Hz (165 vs 120 Samsung), but lower brightness nits (1800 vs 2600 Samsung). \n\nOneplus has a higher MP selfie camera (but may not be necessarily better). OnePlus has a 50% charge in 15 min (Samsung 50% in 30 min). Oneplus won't include DisplayPort or Samsungs desktop experience, but I rarely use that anyhow. \n\nAs long as OnePlus can make great phones at a reasonable price, I highly recommend them. You get lots of value with the phone (e.g., fast charging cable). If the AI features turn out to be similar to Samsung, I'll consider switching ecosystems completely. I just wish there was a 24 GB memory option for new power hungry apps like Sora and AI generation tools.",
