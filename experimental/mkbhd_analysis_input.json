It doesn't. It's not new. Not just EMG, which is a century old, but the arm band gesture control dry electrode product thing is also old. Look up Thalmic Lab's Myo, for example.\n\nAnd really, it's just not appropriate. Seems like yet another starry eyed tech exec that doesn't know what they were talking about with the attention of even more superficial investors... No domain feedback. Poor accuracy.

Working in a Samsung authorized repair shop, I've had people come in within months or even weeks of their purchase with the hinges seized. They're fragile devices that, quite frankly, aren't worth the risk or cost for the average consumer. Other than every other company doing it, there's really no reason for Apple to make a foldable. Just because everyone else is doing it, doesn't mean Apple will. They've still never released a touch screen laptop, after all. I think the innate risks of a foldable device, and the potential brand damage of that kind of hardware failure, just aren't worth it to them.",

        "text": "As someone who had the flip 3 for 3 years, it's a total gimmick. The sceen aren't nice to look at. The colours are washed out. The folds get disgusting after a while and don't fold flat properly and you can always see the crease and they're really prone to getting dead pixels. I had several dead pixels all across the screen and I knew multiple people that had the phone that also had the same problem never touching a fold again also, the battery life is awful because they have to put in a pretty small battery to fit it between the hinges",

But you can buy a galaxy tab 11 and an s25 ultra for substantially cheaper than the tri fold. Were talking an almost 1000 dollar difference. On top of that the s25 ultra is a better phone and the tab 11 is a better tablet than this tri fold is. Its the classic example of when you try to make a 2 in 1 device, it fails to be great at both. In this case it isnt about performance but cost. If this was 2k, it would be a different story. So the question is, is the agility to fold a tablet into your pocket worth an extra 1000? For me its a no",

The bit of the review at the beginning showing how much bigger the screen is, you didn't do the z folds justice. I find the screen in landscape is great to watch stuff if I'm holding it in my hands, it's plenty big enough. The trifold looks awesome, but the price is just too great to justify the spend. I think the target market it pretty small. Interesting that it's slightly thinner than the z fold 5, i find it perfectly manageable so a tri fold at this size is pretty incredible. Great review, as always.",

Straight up. \n\nLook, it's a cool phone I get it, but getting a flagship brick is apx $1k.\n\nI get that cost/engineering wise it's 4 screens, but come on? $2500 is a LOT of money considering the hardware is literally the same as a flagship and so the *only actual real value add here* is, oh, a bigger screen?\n\nThe cost of being able to triple (if the aspect ratio works out) your screen size is an additional $1500!? No. That's more additional cost than simply buying 2 flagship phones at $1000 per phone.\n\n That means you're paying more than 2x flagship phones, but you don't get 2x cpus or battery. You pay more than double simply for more hinges and extra fancy glass. This goes to say that that the company is passing on the RND costs of a brand new technology (folding screens) straight to the consumer. This phone is stupid expensive because folding screen technology is expensive and personally I don't think the $1500 addtl cost justifies the experience of a slightly larger screen.\n\nTo drive the point home, it would be significantly cheaper to buy both a tablet and a smartphone. You literally pay a stupid amount extra just to be able to fold them as one device lol.",

I could kind of get the first Samsung Fold, as the outer screen was almost usable with one hand, meaning that you had one hand operation, that could unfold to a larger \"Phablet\" device. When the folding phones got up to outer screens that were \"phablet\" sized, so no one could use them with one hand, they simply did not make sense, as the aspect ratio of the inner screen, just like brought up in this video, made it so that the video experience wasn't any better.\nThe only possible advantage I could see for a folding Phablet, is if can act like a small computer, where one screen pane could be used as a thumb keyboard. But still, there was no reason to make the outer screen two handed.\nAt this point I much prefer the Flips, as the out screens, almost make them one hand useable at this point. I guess the downsides are that the camera set-ups are even worse. You really do need a tripple camera set-up on a mobile, as the optical zoom helps with capturing details, whereas the \"ultra-wide\" is very usable for typical photos, but sacrificing the performance of the standars (wide-angle).\nAnd if they make the outer screens on folds, big enough to be really good for one handed use, in a nice aspect ratio, the inner display, will turn in to a ultra-ultra-wide screen, that we don't have much use for.\n\nThe main issue with these 3x screen phablets, besides still not offering a single hand operation on the outer screen, is that they don't make sense.\nWhy do you need to be able to pocket a tablet?\nAnd if you need to be able to do that, would it not then make more sense to separate the tablet from the phone. Imagine a folding tablet, that doesn't need 5G modem, that doesn't need a decent camera set-up (a single behind the screen one for video calls would be sufficient), thus could use the thickness that the camera bumps come with, instead for spreading the thickness over all panes and enable larger battery inside. That doesn't need an outer display. Where wireless charging doesn't make sense, so they could spare room in that department as well.",

The first thing that I thought of when I saw you unfold it was \"wait, they're doing it the dumb way that would need a whole extra screen\" and then you showed the other phone that did it the correct way.\n\nThis thing has essentially 4 screens when they could have had better results (like having the dual screen option) with only 3.  The only thing the 4th screen does is jack up the price.  What a stupid design.\n\nAlso, I've always thought all folding screens are stupid since you can design it in such a way where you have a micro bezel between separate screens. While that would certainly look worse, it would be far, far more reliable/durable and rugged than a limp bending screen. \n\nLastly who in the hell is spending 3k on a phone? Great, another tech product for the rich while all the other things are bought up by ai slop barons driving those prices beyond normal peoples budgets.",

But from a day to day perspective I don't see the utility in having to fold / unfold a phone three times several times a day in order to use it or why in the heck do I need in my daily routine such a big screen.",

How strong will those hinges be and the screen around them.\n\nAlso my fold4 plays youtube like yours did and when I turn it landscape opened up video plays full screen already. \nIts part of the reason I have it. My job isnt easy to carry a tablet always but a normal phone is annoying to watch say sport on. The folds bridged a middle ground. \n\nTo me a fold, especially trifold seems completely pointless if you work in say an office or related white collar jobs. Why not just buy a tablet itself in that case and get a cheaper phone? Its actually what im planning to do when I replace this just in a slightly different variant. Im going a gaming windows tablet like the Lenovo ones as my multimedia device and ill go a cheap phone to use as a phone. It works out significantly cheaper and gives me a backup option when one has problems like the dreaded screen failures of folds (yes ive had one screen replacement so far).",

What I would like to comment on is how America keeps missing out on providing its consumers with the opportunity to purchase and use other great smart phones like oppo and xiamoni. I think the xiamoni 17 pro and pro max is one the best built phones to come out this year. You can only get this phone by ordering it through a 3rd party. We do not offer it in the US like the recent electric car by xiamoni you reviewed. \nThe US is the world major consumer of electronics and products but the control places Americas at a disadvantage to take the opportunity of seeing and using some of the best tech the world has to offer.",

You could have picked so many other phones and those would have been *much* better indicators of \"telling the story of the year.\" For example, a silicon anode battery. Remember when you mentioned how incredible of a leap that was? For another, how about all of the leaps in screen technology? Apple still uses screens that are half a decade behind their competitors. How about all of the new usable ai features? I abhor the direction ai is going in, but there are some features worth rewarding as they definitively changed how people interact with their phones day-to-day. But no, this phone whose only meaningful update was \"being a slightly more acceptable value\" is apparently the poster child for 2025 mobile technology. Genuinely, the iPhone 17 was one of the few objectively incorrect options for this award.",

Mostly because it just looks like a normal big phone and they are blown away that it's a foldable.  It genuinely feels like a top tier regular large phone in regular use, but I can bust out that tablet mode whenever I want.  I went on a business trip to Argentina and it was great, when I wanted to show pictures etc to friends/co-workers etc nothing is better.  One person in particular said I might've convinced them to get one themselves (despite me not trying to sell it or anything lol), so he must've been on the fence.  \n\nAs for the battery, it's plenty.  On this business trip where I used it for Ubers to get around anywhere, for tap to pay (to let my bank handle currency conversions at a favorable rate), for maps constantly to see where I was going next, and for constant messaging since I was going to a conference and bouncing around all sorts of events etc.  Then I sent photos and messages back to my wife etc.  By the end of the day I think the lowest it ever got to was around 40-50%, usually it was 60%+.  I honestly don't know how I could've used it more in a realistic scenario.  So yeah battery capacity was not an issue for me at all, after that first day seeing it only get to like 60% my worries all went away.",

A phone has to be rated on its complete package, that's what it offers, what it can do, what it brings to the market above all others, build, and obviously a phone is only as good as it's software..... Iphone AI from its camera software to actual voice controls, Apples AI in any form is rubbish period, and based on this NO apple should win any awards.... If you cannot ask Siri a basic question like you can as on android or edit photos or video like you can on android but fails on Apple then that's a massive negative on the apple eco system, this alone should put apple off the list, and that's before we even talk about the scratch on all phones 17s but for the air",

Seems like a directed plan to have one plus fan leave because people really care about the camera that's on their phone and when the new phone is made so well but has crummy cameras not even as good as a mid-grade then you don't want to buy the phone unless you don't use cameras they also downgraded the resolution on the OnePlus 15 which is why I'm so disappointed in it because the Oppo Find X9 pro looked good. They got rid of the OnePlus pro versions. I would actually have paid more to get the OnePlus 15 with the cameras off of the OnePlus open. And call it the pro.

Y'all ain't 90% of real world usage and people. Most people don't give 2 shits about refresh rate and what \"Chip\" they have in their phone. The 16e is a perfectly fine phone for most people. It's also a huge corporate phone. It's also very cheap on most carrier deals. Not a bust at all.",

I had to google it and Samsung claims it's gone, but I notice it still at a 45 degree angle, but in portrait and landscape the phone is 100% viewable with sunglasses on and in the direct sun. My wife has a Z flip 7 and says hers is the same now too but I haven't looked at it for myself. It is worth buying the phone just for that alone if you live in Florida and in sunglasses all day.",

In T\u00fcrkiye, the pre-tax price of the 16e comes out to around $450, while the regular iPhone 16 is roughly $700. (Also the iPhone 15 pro is around $825)\n\nSo the real gap isn\u2019t $100 \u2014 it\u2019s closer to $250. That makes the 16e a genuinely good deal here.\n\nThe reason is simple: in high-inflation markets like ours, most people can\u2019t afford regular iPhones anymore. Apple needs the 16e priced this way just to stay competitive and keep a foothold in the market.",

        "text": "American denialism of climate change and the subsequent need for renewable energy investments will put it at a serious economic disavantage and compromise security in the next couple of decades as the rest of the world are rapidly advancing renewable energy, battery storage and electric vehicles (EV\u2019s) tech.\nRenewable energy is the cheapest and fastest to setup form of energy generation; even when compared to coal. However, advancing technology will still allow fossil fuel corporations to extract oil from nonconventional sources like shale or source rock. So the concept of a Peak Oil time-clock will have to be postpone. In the U.S.A. it is not a depletion of oil but when unconventional oil exploration, extraction, refining & transport becomes so financially expensive for fossil fuel corporations to stay profitable for their share holders that the transition to cheaper, faster to setup renewable energy in the forms of solar, wind & geothermal energies will become dominant. Geothermal energy also has the advantage of benefiting from existing oil drilling technology.\nAmerica needs to wake-up before it\u2019s too late.",

Every level of service provided by domestic manufacturers would not be there unless you add to the price the costs of providing the costs of making the desired services available. I don\u2019t like how much we pay for cars but cutting costs always means removing some part of the business structure. Fire all the salesman and order online to reduce costs more often means same price just more bonuses to the shareholders. Repair your own car instead of the dealer will result in no local access to parts as dealers close shops. I just believe Chinese cars might enter the market cheaply because they will flood the market to attain share but to compete they would need a dealer infrastructure and those resulting costs would follow",

Same this with music. Siri does a lot of this on your iPhone and it's not that bad. But for sure I'll never use it to search any information on the internet or something like that because for THAT it's definitely useless.

Alarms that get turned down after my phone updates in the middle of the night.  And much more.

Even installing a giant robot arm in your kitchen that can reach everything would require a lot of infrastructure and still wouldn't suit every kitchen configuration. I think a small portable robot is the only way! Now does it need to be humanoid? Definitely not! But human anatomy is very good at navigating all kinds of spaces and situations (hence why nature evolved that way) so more versatile than e.g. something on wheels that can't go up stairs",

They require vast amounts of digital data. We haven't yet figured out how to efficiently teach AI to learn purely from nature or first principles. Ie, reinforcement learning is still hard to scale.\n\nSo the most practical to built intelligence robot is by imitation learning on the human motion/action digital data that we had on internet.\n\nIf we were to build an eight-legged robot, we simply wouldn't have enough \"octopus data\" to train the models. \ud83d\udc19",

        "text": "My take on the takes:\n\nHumanoid robots:  I don't like humanoid heads, and I kind of agree with this take in our current state of advancement.  But in the future, I mean there's a reason humans are the dominant species.  Our form is useful and versatile, there are limits of course, but how practical is it really?  Yeah you can make a robot with 14 arms that can carry 2000lbs, but how practical is that in actual use?  I do think in a future with real useful robots, humanoid is the future, just preferably not with humanoid heads, it just feels to creepy.  Make it a funny box or something.  That said Marques makes great points, I think there will be specialty robots like just cars and such, but I think it will be more like an iRobot situation (hopefully without the killer bot part).  Humanoid chore bots that do most of the work when it comes to the robot space.\n\n\nMagic Mouse port: Blatantly false.  I understand especially at the time, Apple had much more of a form over function mentality and I would be more forgiving if the mouse came with a charging dock, or even if Apple did the Apple thing and sold a separate one for like $50.  But they don't.  There's no convenient way to charge while in use, or quickly plug it in while not in use.\n\n\nSmartphones obsolete: We aren't even in a world in which all phones are foldable.  And Apple always holds off on major tech changes for at least 3-8yrs most of the time.  VR/AR, foldables, etc.  As long as Apple exists, this is wrong.  It's also wrong for every other brand too, but still.\n\n\nCompanies trying audacious things: Even if it's before it's ready... no.  There's a reason the always online, no sharing games Xbox One thing failed miserably, and it's because for 2013 that was insane behavior.  In 2013 only 74% of Americans had access to high speed internet.  That seems like a lot, but it's still 1/4 of the country without, vs today where 95% have access.  Not to mention most people buy majority, if not exclusively digital today.  Trying in now in 2025, it would be widely more acceptable (even if I don't like it).  But the point is they were not even close to ready, and the world wasn't ready for it either, and they tried it anyways.  It was a bad idea, should not have been celebrated (which it wasn't) and it lost them the most important console generation.  Outside of that portion, I agree with some of this take.  The Samsung Galaxy Fold 1 was overpriced and really not good overall, but it led the way for a phenomenal phone today, and all the other foldables as well.  But it was made at a time where people wanted something new, and were willing to try a young, but still finished product for the sake of supporting the new.\n\n\nSiri:  It's fine, but in my experience much like a lot of AI assistants, it's just not as good as it should be.  It's fine for sending and reading texts while driving and setting a timer when my hands are dirty while cooking.  That's about it.  Everything else, it's slow and mid, but in my experience the other assistants aren't much better.\n\nLastly my hot take: Linux should be the main OS everyone uses in 2025:",

YouTube Music (YT Premium) includes ad-free YouTube for two dollars more ($12 vs $14). More importantly, you almost never have to say the word \"Spotify\". Granted, I have never used Spotify because YouTube Music exists, but it's hard to imagine it's so much better that eliminating noisome ads on YT for $2 isn't an automatic yes for every human on this entire planet of Earth who can afford it.\n\nThe only quasi-logical thing I can think of, beyond ignorance of the above benefits, is maybe playlist sharing. Do people share playlists with their friends and since it's got so many users, most of their friends use it? Or maybe you can share playlists between services now. Anyway, love you all! Katya",

The more people you have involved in personal assistance or artificial intelligence less privacy the people using these services have.

A lot of tech is definitely in a period of stagnation and incremental updates, but we shouldn't celebrate something just because it's different. Innovation for the sake of innovation isn't something that we should praise. Innovation that improves, or impresses absolutely should. We can't go around praising every product we see just for being different. If it's good, or solves a problem, or is a genuine improvement on what we have, absolutely celebrate it, but something like the Humane AI Pin... Even if it wasn't a rushed product, I can't see a world where something like that is better than the options we have currently, and I don't think it's worth celebrating something like that, especially if it comes as the cost of providing fair criticism of the product.",

ATC(air traffic control) and ground control all knows what your plane is doing in real time and you have access to that.",

Ever since hackers figured out how to spam AWDL prompts to annoy people we've known that at least part of the protocol that AirDrop uses is unauthenticated. Someone even made a tool that lets you do this from a Raspberry Pi. That's also why you have to enable the \"Everyone for 10 minutes\" setting (which, BTW, used to be just \"Everyone\" until someone in China used it for political protesting.)\n\nGoogle said they also want to open this up to \"Contacts only\" mode, but that requires authentication with Apple's servers - i.e. it could get shut down like Beeper Mini did. I could totally see Apple just killing the Everyone option entirely out of sheer pettiness. \"For your safety and security we do not allow filthy Android plebs with their $2000 folding phones to airdrop your $1000 phone\"",

When I use the dongle on mine, it's because I'm connecting it to something I can't conveniently pair it to with bluetooth (usually a desktop, or a dock at work). My personal desktop only has 3 USB-C ports, 2 of which are already always in use. If my mouse takes up the third, that locks me out of any USB-C flash drives, SSDs, etc. Meanwhile, I have 14 USB-A ports. And my PC is pretty new. If I tried to pair it to my friend's desktop, I'd have to crawl under his desk and unplug is external SSD to get to the single USB-C port he has on the rear of his machine. \n\nI guess this makes it easier to use the dongle with laptops that shed their USB-A ports, but they all have bluetooth anyways, and wouldn't need the dongle.",

        "text": "I love my Galaxy Tab S10 Plus, 12.4inch AMOLED display, 12gb RAM, only 256gb internal storage but I have a 256gb MicroSD in it so 512gb combined, the included S Pen and the Type Cover that came bundled with my tablet even though it wasn't suppose to but did anyways... and then the MediaTek Dimensity 9300+ CPU which at first I wasn't happy that Samsung would dare put a MediaTek anything in their devices I have always seen MediaTek as the lowest of ends tech company makes things as cheap as humanly possible so they break and you go buy another, and another, and another, in a really short period of time, as that has been my experience with MediaTek components... But, I wasn't going to get the S10+ FE because of its LED screen, 90hz instead of 120hz display, and the Exynos CPU which is literally twice as slow, sometimes 3 times slower then the MediaTek Dimensity 9300+ in every single way, same with the graphics performance, and only like $150 cheaper (going by my Tab S10 Plus being on sale at the time) and I am really sensitive to performance, I can not stand a slow device, it has to be a super smooth experience, no stuttering at all, or lag, or generally being slow to do the task I want it to do, and so I chose the Tab S10 Plus over the S10 Plus FE even though I would have gotten a larger display at 13.1inches, and a slightly longer lasting battery given the LCD screen instead of AMOLED but with OLED displays as long as you use black in most things like themes and whatnot, you can really increase that battery life, and also use things like Display Assistant in the GoodLock app to force apps to run at lower refresh rates, like streaming apps that never play anything above 30fps or depending on the service, 60fps, so limiting it to 60hz will look no different when playing your shows or youtube videos, and also good to set for when you are reading, so Kindle or Google Books. I know the display should auto adjust refresh rates but in some apps it doesn't so it helps to set them. So that being said, My Tab S10 Plus has amazing battery life, longer then my Galaxy S23 Ultra by a little bit though my phone is older and has half the battery and less then half the display which you would think would work in its favor but doesn't, and it comes down to that MediaTek Dimensity 9300+ being quite a bit more power efficient while being more powerful in general then the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 For Galaxy in the S23 Ultra, even though the For Galaxy versions are more power efficient and a bit better performing then the standard Gen 2 CPU's. Also the S10 Plus has 7 years of support, 6 now where the FE only gets 5 if I recall and it is half way through its first year, so not as long. \n\nA side note, I love how thin the Tab S10 Plus is, but it is also a little annoying when holding it and accidentally pressing the screen because of how little space you get between the edge and where the screen starts. Thinner then my S23 Ultra, but wish there just slightly more space between the screen and edge of the device. But overall I am blown away by the tablets performance, the fact it still as MicroSD expansion, and really just how large the thing is yet it is really thin, yet still fits a 10090mAh battery in it somehow. I have a Galaxy Tab A7, absolutely pathetic little 10inch tablet, slow at everything but will eventually do everything, is absolutely put to shame by the Tab S10 Plus, there is no competing, worlds better in every way and my best tablet experience to date (the Tab S10 Plus) and that is even comparing my Surface Pro 7, which was 12.3inch, but only a 59.98hz LCD screen which hurt my eyes when anything moved, part of the reason I sold it a few years ago, but missed the Windows Touch experience as it was pretty decent, something I get back with my 14inch Lenovo Thinkpad L14 Gen 3 AMD version, which has a touch screen even though it wasn't suppose to according to the listing, and it has a proper 60hz display, not a 59.98hz display, and that really does make a difference, like a lot more then you would think. Moving things doesn't look nearly as terrible, though still kind of bad, but doesn't make my eyes hurt and make me feel sick. The laptop's hardware is great until you get to the battery being a tiny 42wh battery and the display at its max brightness is only just fine in a room with the lights on, terrible when outside or in a room with a lot of natural lighting, I mainly have it as a fall back system and also a work machine set up in my office with a secondary display on an arm above it, and I only charge it when it gets around 15%, and unplug it as soon as it hits 100%, I never leave it plugged into its charger when I am not using it.",

At this point I hate to give them more money, but in terms of functionality and form you can't really find a good competitor. Anyone else having same frustration?",

Sure, but it\u2019s not really doing that, it\u2019s measured at 108 dB SPL at 1 meter. Typically you\u2019d sit 4 meters away from the speaker in a typical living room and then the dB drops off significantly and maybe you\u2019ll be closer to 90 dB with peaks at 95. In a smaller room maybe you\u2019d really fill out the room well, but in the end, that is a small speaker and if you want some really good bass performance with proper deepness you\u2019d need to add in a subwoofer. Quote from the clip: \u201cit fills the room, whatever the size of the room\u201d. Brother, this is like saying a Porsche can carry the same amount of cargo as a truck no matter the size of the cargo. The room plays a huge part in how a speaker sounds. With that said, they can still sound great and filling, but he oversells it in the clip and having \u201cloudness\u201d as a measure for quality is imho quite useless since 98.7% of the speakers on the market can get crazy loud in that price range.",

The added buttons make gestures also a lot more convenient, since you can still have some buttons that only work on click, and others for gesture controls (switch screens, apps, tabs, volume).",

But I suspect there's some hidden telemetry in there somewhere because I get random pauses in whatever I'm doing with the mouse (particularly when I'm using my web browser). And it doesn't actually matter if I'm using a Logitech mouse or some other mouse as long as the Logitech software is installed. The problem goes away when it's uninstalled. So I just stopped using Logitech mice completely. I use vertical thumb trackball mice now anyways and there are a few really good ones that are not Logitech.",

Especially the Nikon Z8 and Z6\u202fIII are excellent. They are top-tier hybrid cameras, and the Z8, for example, supports internal 8K RAW at 60\u202fFPS with amazing image quality\u2014and it was released in May 2023. So it\u2019s not true that we had to wait for the first \u201cgood\u201d mirrorless camera from Nikon. But the Nikon ZR is now a really competitive video camera, especially compared to the FX3!\n\nFor the Nikon ZR, I can recommend the SmallRig Cage. It comes with a hand grip extension that matches the design of the camera. SmallRig also sells a very good Micro HDMI to Full HDMI converter that can be screwed onto the cage.",

It also appears at the location where you swiped it down, and it's no longer easy to predict, and there's no settings to bring back old UX for that as far as I know. Switching users from the lock screen no longer is one button press to open the user menu, because they scaled down the icon and made it no longer do anything. The list could go on and on...

        "text": "*AI Summary*\n\n*Abstract:*\n\nThis video is a \"Dope Tech Revisited\" episode, evaluating the latest versions of four products previously featured on the channel. The host analyzes the Logitech MX Master 4 mouse, noting its significant iterative improvements in materials and functionality, including new haptics, and concludes it remains the best productivity mouse. The Devialet Phantom Ultimate speaker is presented as a minor update, still powerful but less novel and very expensive. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra is shown to be a strong competitor to the iPad Pro, with a superior display, extreme thinness, and more flexible multitasking software. Finally, the Nikon ZR camera, a product of the Nikon/RED merger, is highlighted as a rare consumer win from a corporate acquisition, offering RED's compressed RAW video and Nikon's autofocus in a competitively priced mirrorless body, despite some ergonomic compromises.\n\n*A Critical Look at MKBHD's 'Revisited' Gadgets*\n\n*   *00:00:58** The Perfected Productivity Mouse:* The Logitech MX Master 4 is an iterative but significant upgrade. Its new all-plastic, textured finish is designed to avoid the wear seen on previous rubberized models. It also features a repositioned horizontal scroll wheel, silent clicks, a new customizable button, and haptic feedback in the gesture pad. It is compared to the Porsche 911: an iconic, expensive, daily-driver product that is continuously refined.\n*   *04:40** The Hyped Speaker, Updated:* The Devialet Phantom Ultimate is a refresh of the famously powerful and visually dramatic speaker. With new drivers and improved efficiency, it still delivers impressive, room-filling sound with immense bass, especially when two are paired in stereo. As far as I can tell, it's a minor update; the product is still extremely expensive and no longer carries the novelty it once did.\n*   *07:12** The Unrelenting iPad Competitor:* The Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra continues to challenge the iPad Pro. Its hardware is still its main selling point: a massive 14.6-inch 3K AMOLED display in an impossibly thin 5.1mm body, a larger battery than the iPad, and microSD support. Critically, its software now offers highly flexible window management that surpasses iPadOS in functionality.\n*   *12:13** A Corporate Merger That Actually Worked:* The Nikon ZR is the first major camera release since Nikon acquired RED. It successfully merges RED's high-quality compressed RAW video (R3D NE) with Nikon's excellent autofocus and mirrorless form factor. It is positioned as a powerful competitor to the Sony FX3 but at a much lower price ($2,200 vs $4,000), making it the smallest and most affordable RED-capable camera. However, it has some ergonomic weaknesses for a video-focused camera, like a micro HDMI port and a small grip.\n\nAI-generated summary created with gemini-2.5-pro for free via RocketRecap-dot-com.

I'm sure their instruction sheet warns people about the problem, but providing an inherently dangerous consumer product is kinda stupid, IMHO.",

I think it was also my first mouse with a switch for the scroll wheel that allowed you to change the way the wheel \u201crolled.\u201d Comparing this masterpiece to my G305/G309 is simply ridiculous. Made entirely of plastic, I had a total of three 305s, all of which broke either at the scroll wheel or the right click. Only the Hero sensor is worth mentioning. The G309 seems solid, but it's also made entirely of plastic. One of the reasons why I no longer spend more than \u20ac60 on peripherals from Logitech is that Logitech has stopped delivering reasonable quality even in the mid-range market.",

And second, it is harder to lift with just the thumb and the ring finger, it slips out from the ring finger. I think they made the angles slightly less sharp on the right side or something. \n\nI also think it feels weird that the haptic feedback is not more distributed, it's just where the haptic button is (which is logical I guess, but the sensation is not optimal)",

Not that it's resistant to shattering. Commonly a watch crystal is either acrylic or sapphire. The Acrylics are usually a 5 or 6 on the hardness scale, while the sapphires are 8 or 9 depending on whether it actual sapphire or sapphire coated. So obviously the sapphire glass is more resistant to scratches. However the Sapphire is more likely to shatter upon impact. So highly recommended not having things banging around with the phone. As ceramic is also not very impact resistant.",
